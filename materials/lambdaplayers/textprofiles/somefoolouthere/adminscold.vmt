this is hurting both of us
thats not allowed here
if you dont agree with the server's rules then just leave
please follow the rules
even us admins will get punished for doing crap like that

ill let you off with a warning this time
the rules should be in the motd so just type !motd in the chat and you should see it
if you do it again i will kick you
im gonna ban you if you dont stop

is it hard to follow the rules
just dont do it again
dont let this be a problem
