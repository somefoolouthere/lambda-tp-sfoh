i wanna ride that
yay
this is a thing to do
take me somewhere
cruisin
i want vandoorea to make black mesa and entropy zero 2 remixes
been riding for the past 40 minutes
i still dont know why they added 5
partys over
black magic sounds like its so much older than it actually is
they're teasing us
i saw a really cool video  on reddit today
darkness
still need my gmod minutes
my pc is gonna turn off again
ok uh
i love this
this is even better
not a good map for making interiors out of props as you can see
laggy as heck
i hate these stupid food entities from crunchys pickups
the lighting looks awesome though
honestly almost looks like a ray traced render
well now i wanna go on justgrass and build it
alright things just keep on breaking im deleting this
gotta love 144 fps
sweet
sweed
this is already looking better
ah lets do hthis
now where do i put the light switch
precision building has never been so easy in gmod
its beautiful
oh you know what i could have done
ayy
i need to convert realworldtextures to material tool
remember when dxr in minecraft used to work better
miss those days
it sure does feel like im playing with ray tracing right now
gonna have a party in here
this thing is gonna be awesome when im done
this is gonna be bad for performance
i need a ruler tool
gonna have to do some pythag theorem
it would be more convenient if i could use the calculator in game
i should get a second monitor
yea impressed by my own thing
the sprops materials have a little shine like with pbr
feels like im playing minecraft with ray tracing
check this out
i made this
nether mind
expanding time
im building stuff guys
im actually doing something in gmod
checc it out
im that impressed by my own thing
is it opposite day or what
what the heck are these cubes
how do i fix this
why did this happen
wow this is super broken
issue found https://github.com/wiremod/wire/issues/2552
so the sin of 45 is supposed to equal 1/√2
ive been insulted too many times today
dont ask how i knew sin was gotten
4 months by the way
i dont need any advanced material tool cause map retexturizer lets me do it
id like to leave school early
hey we should like throw a party in here
triage at dawn is overrated
i heard someone listening to keep ya head up today
this material reminds me of the concrete material from roblox
i still think we should throw a party in here
uuh
im unsure how im gonna do lighting
im stuck
|nearmusicbox|pretty based music choice
you may not really like hip hop or you may hate it but you cant deny that 2pac made good music
imagine how good the gmod maps would look if we had support for phong on world textures and put phong like fake pbr on all the textures
not sure if you know this but in pbr 1 roughness still has a some shine
i worked with pbr textures in the past in minecraft
i gotta find a way to port my pack to java edition

how dang rare is it to find a 60 fps youtube video now
yeah what kind of crazy person doesnt put a light_environment in their map
rip 32 bit beamng.drive
it feels like something is missing now
map runs good enough
i wanna see what we have for riverden edits

|nearmusicbox|i was wondering what in the world this song could be when i first heard it
in all seriousness labyrinthine doesnt seem too bad to be on self radio
is it 5.26 years or 5.3 years for cobalt
theres still more tracks i havent heard
for some reason this seems normal
yesterday was an awful day
its actually kinda painful listening to tracks like 10 minutes or longer
how do you like ambient music
give me ideas
what a day
what are you doing
oh whats going on with drunk headcrab
someone help me
i literally had 3 meals today and i feel like im starving

i dislike not afraid remix so much i left it out of my mix
i wonder if multithreading would greatly improve the speed
i miss b adams on my self radio
this better turn out how i wanted it to
i got a lag spike
im hungry
would be great if audacity used ram
i really need something to backup my crap
right now if my ssd dies i lose so many things
|nearmusicbox|was this song released in 2022
pretty glad i got 2 tb
why do i have 74% memory usage
its getting too close
dang it that scared me
i thought it crashed
crap did it again
gotta take a shower real soon
that was a mistake
how do i go back
well now i gotta redo the whole thing
i wish i didnt do that
i hate doing this
i think my anger made me take a shorter shower
i hate myself so much for that
i was literally like 4 minutes away from it being done
i see af23 addon i subscribe
and now i wait for the gmod devs to update x86-64
we wait
gmod seems dead right now
i did download the april 1st version of the tornado maps
steam froze
ok its unfrozen
people making schools in gmod
ooooooh
95% ram usage
why is it so high
only got 1.6 gb free
its gonna be alright
this sucks so much
10^(x/20)
dont worry guys we got small optimizations for seamless portals
i got a hair in my mouse and thought my pc froze
what is what
holy crap my pc is brought down to a crawl
lets finally play this game
actually didnt i say something about that earlier today
yeah see
i need to learn how to beat match
gta v really didnt want me to leave online early

0 dropped frames and my game doesnt run bad

i cant believe something interesting happened at that time
i uninstalled the stupid movies and tv app
dysphoria is on self radio
not the best solution but it most certainly is the cheapest
wow nice joke i had there
my joke tracks linger after april 1st
im stuck with em
the sad part about this is that i basically did this all on myself
i heard the cover version 3 times today its ridiculous
those are some pretty big spaces
how do i crop videos

|nearmusicbox|i never heard this song before
whats wrong with this
i already have a bad feeling about this
gta v is a super quiet game

found some random pedwiik clips
i have suppressed chromium.log writing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kwwl9jiJ1A4 idk if you remember this
its only been 88 minutes?

aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah
whats the reason why i keep on getting shader cache downloads for portal rtx
i think i got the regex thing
and i wish it was 019
trying to make it a little more like 019
theres not much i can do
reshade has been stuck on compiling shaders for a while
ogg at quality 0 still sounds too good
if i make my own music im always gonna use 48000 hz
oh of course everyone likes stanky legg
da got that dope
i have no idea what to build
i hope i made 4 people happy
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2971265319 when you want the lambda player experience but not as crazy
i cant believe something i made got on the front page
why do the universal ammo entities and only the universal ammo entities give a lua error when a lambda player spawns it
come on lets go play with lambda players together
i hate crunchys ultimate item pickups so much
how to kill a gpu
why do i always say things like that
i wanna try to make a food spawner in gmod today

not sure what i wanna add

easy precision looks pretty cool

it seems weird that its happened so many times
i eat food for no reason
|nearmusicbox|WHY DOES THAT KEEP ON HAPPENING
WHY DOES THAT KEEP ON HAPPENING
gimme food
thats a stupid username /rndply/
making me nervous
the amount of times i heard who do you love today
map creator shoulda made those paths func_details
universal ammo isnt universal

|nearmusicbox|AGAIN

i was aware something like this might happen one day
FLINT COAL
wheres this stupid thruster

im not sure what would happen if you drank blood
i really wonder what my blood type is
could you help me with that too
ok well phong and envmap are compatible
i did not know this material had phong and envmap at the same time
but can you have envmap and rimlight?
i will use lambda for playing hl2 in gmod
and the whole place is polluted with random props
uhoh
why did i spawn here
so the current plan is that im gonna go on youtube every single day until i cant anymore
like i plan on spending the entire tomorrow on youtube
4 years and 144 fps is still really smooth to me
i wonder if abh is patched in entropy zero 2
ah i wanna edit the navmesh but
forget it im doing it
what the
this is crazy
the closest thing we got to real time reflections on props
so yeah til you can have phong along with envmap
i was wondering why some decals disappeared when i went a certain distance
oh nooooooooo
i wonder what kinds of stuff i could draw
i dont stop doing stupid things
i dont play gta v on saturday anymore
gmod is boring too
literally every game i play is boring now
thats still bullcrap
func_details are used improperly on this map
yeah still trying to find songs and soon im not gonna be able to anymore
making cursed guns
yeah this looks very cursed
it could have been worse
ok this looks bad now
yeah there we go
oh this is awful
