did you happen to read the rules
partys over
this is hurting both of us
thats not allowed here
if you dont agree with the server's rules then just leave
please follow the rules
even us admins will get punished for doing crap like that
just dont do it again ok
ill let you off with a warning this time
the rules should be in the motd so just type !motd in the chat and you should see it
if you do it again i will kick you
im gonna ban you if you dont stop
stop it
is it hard to follow the rules
just dont do it again
dont let this be a problem
