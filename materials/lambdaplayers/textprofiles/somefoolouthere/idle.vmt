yay

take me somewhere
cruisin
i want vandoorea to make black mesa and entropy zero 2 remixes
been riding for the past 40 minutes
i still dont know why they added 5
partys over
black magic sounds like its so much older than it actually is
they're teasing us
i saw a really cool video  on reddit today
darkness
still need my gmod minutes
my pc is gonna turn off again
ok uh
i love this
this is even better
not a good map for making interiors out of props as you can see
laggy as heck
i hate these stupid food entities from crunchys pickups
the lighting looks awesome though
honestly almost looks like a ray traced render
well now i wanna go on justgrass and build it
alright things just keep on breaking im deleting this
gotta love 144 fps
sweet
sweed
this is already looking better
ah lets do hthis
now where do i put the light switch
precision building has never been so easy in gmod
its beautiful
oh you know what i could have done
ayy
i need to convert realworldtextures to material tool
remember when dxr in minecraft used to work better
miss those days
it sure does feel like im playing with ray tracing right now
gonna have a party in here
this thing is gonna be awesome when im done
this is gonna be bad for performance
i need a ruler tool
gonna have to do some pythag theorem
it would be more convenient if i could use the calculator in game
i should get a second monitor
yea impressed by my own thing

i made this
nether mind

wow this is super broken
issue found https://github.com/wiremod/wire/issues/2552
so the sin of 45 is supposed to equal 1/√2
ive been insulted too many times today
dont ask how i knew sin was gotten
4 months by the way
i dont need any advanced material tool cause map retexturizer lets me do it
id like to leave school early
hey we should like throw a party in here
triage at dawn is overrated
i heard someone listening to keep ya head up today
this material reminds me of the concrete material from roblox
i still think we should throw a party in here
uuh
im unsure how im gonna do lighting
im stuck
|nearmusicbox|pretty based music choice
you may not really like hip hop or you may hate it but you cant deny that 2pac made good music
imagine how good the gmod maps would look if we had support for phong on world textures and put phong like fake pbr on all the textures
not sure if you know this but in pbr 1 roughness still has a some shine
i worked with pbr textures in the past in minecraft
i gotta find a way to port my pack to java edition

rip 32 bit beamng.drive
it feels like something is missing now

is it 5.26 years or 5.3 years for cobalt
theres still more tracks i havent heard
for some reason this seems normal
yesterday was an awful day
its actually kinda painful listening to tracks like 10 minutes or longer
how do you like ambient music

oh whats going on with drunk headcrab
someone help me
i literally had 3 meals today and i feel like im starving

i dislike not afraid remix so much i left it out of my mix
i wonder if multithreading would greatly improve the speed
i miss b adams on my self radio
this better turn out how i wanted it to
i got a lag spike
im hungry
would be great if audacity used ram
i really need something to backup my crap
right now if my ssd dies i lose so many things
|nearmusicbox|was this song released in 2022
pretty glad i got 2 tb
why do i have 74% memory usage
its getting too close
dang it that scared me
i thought it crashed
crap did it again
gotta take a shower real soon
that was a mistake
how do i go back
well now i gotta redo the whole thing
i wish i didnt do that
i hate doing this
i think my anger made me take a shorter shower
i hate myself so much for that
i was literally like 4 minutes away from it being done
i see af23 addon i subscribe
and now i wait for the gmod devs to update x86-64
we wait
gmod seems dead right now
i did download the april 1st version of the tornado maps
steam froze
ok its unfrozen
people making schools in gmod
ooooooh
95% ram usage
why is it so high
only got 1.6 gb free
its gonna be alright
this sucks so much
10^(x/20)
dont worry guys we got small optimizations for seamless portals
i got a hair in my mouse and thought my pc froze
what is what
holy crap my pc is brought down to a crawl
lets finally play this game

i uninstalled the stupid movies and tv app
dysphoria is on self radio
not the best solution but it most certainly is the cheapest

the sad part about this is that i basically did this all on myself
i heard the cover version 3 times today its ridiculous

that car looks kinda cool
that /nearprop/ looks kinda cool
i am still trying to find songs
was pretty productive in minecraft yesterday /s
i have a hosts file that somehow doesnt work in the gmod media player request browser
what difference do the x264 cpu usage presets have
at least i got stuff done today
its like that thing ive seen people do
whats my favorite track
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand
|nearmusicbox|oh yeah 2010s song time

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2974266637
at least theres a few songs i know the lyrics to fully
i got one subscriber
i got over 100 gb of gmod addons

id like to have some offline gif tools
ok so im done
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2974431477

https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/2037360257083237964/CA8AAEDB730E6C3229FA26FADC6AC410EBC74D6B/?imw=5000&imh=5000&ima=fit&impolicy=Letterbox&imcolor=#000000&letterbox=false
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah i dont have anything to do

i have no better ideas than the stupid one i had
i can see it
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah
whats the reason why i keep on getting shader cache downloads for portal rtx
i think i got the regex thing
and i wish it was 019
trying to make it a little more like 019
theres not much i can do
reshade has been stuck on compiling shaders for a while
ogg at quality 0 still sounds too good
if i make my own music im always gonna use 48000 hz
oh of course everyone likes stanky legg
da got that dope
i have no idea what to build
i hope i made 4 people happy
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2971265319 when you want the lambda player experience but not as crazy
i cant believe something i made got on the front page
why do the universal ammo entities and only the universal ammo entities give a lua error when a lambda player spawns it
come on lets go play with lambda players together
i hate crunchys ultimate item pickups so much
how to kill a gpu
why do i always say things like that
i wanna try to make a food spawner in gmod today
can you have transparent profile pictures in steam?
not sure what i wanna add
found something
new thing
easy precision looks pretty cool
i need 15 players
it seems weird that its happened so many times
i eat food for no reason
|nearmusicbox|WHY DOES THAT KEEP ON HAPPENING
WHY DOES THAT KEEP ON HAPPENING
gimme food
thats a stupid username /rndply/
making me nervous
the amount of times i heard who do you love today
map creator shoulda made those paths func_details
universal ammo isnt universal
is there any map good for 5 team ctf
forget it im blowing this up
how does my game not crash
|nearmusicbox|AGAIN

i need some car models
dang iiiit
im glad gmod doesnt freeze anymore when something gets removed

i wanna go back to christruct
what day was it when i had that other thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReZm_e2LHB4

ads are just too intrusive in most places
i was aware something like this might happen one day
FLINT COAL
wheres this stupid thruster
wheres this stupid /nearprop/
im not sure what would happen if you drank blood
i really wonder what my blood type is
could you help me with that too
ok well phong and envmap are compatible
i did not know this material had phong and envmap at the same time
but can you have envmap and rimlight?
i will use lambda for playing hl2 in gmod
and the whole place is polluted with random props
uhoh
why did i spawn here
so the current plan is that im gonna go on youtube every single day until i cant anymore
like i plan on spending the entire tomorrow on youtube
4 years and 144 fps is still really smooth to me
i wonder if abh is patched in entropy zero 2
ah i wanna edit the navmesh but
forget it im doing it
what the
this is crazy
the closest thing we got to real time reflections on props
so yeah til you can have phong along with envmap
i was wondering why some decals disappeared when i went a certain distance
oh nooooooooo
i wonder what kinds of stuff i could draw
i dont stop doing stupid things
i dont play gta v on saturday anymore
gmod is boring too
literally every game i play is boring now
thats still bullcrap
func_details are used improperly on this map
yeah still trying to find songs and soon im not gonna be able to anymore
making cursed guns
yeah this looks very cursed
it could have been worse
ok this looks bad now
yeah there we go
oh this is awful
this looks bad too
nah im gonna make more cursed guns
i opted into the steam client beta
betterrtx is out but you can only get it from discord
insert skull emoji here that i cant insert because windows is a piece of crap sometimes
https://i.redd.it/fbmxrb02dsza1.gif
i can still go on the youtube website
noooooooo madotspooki why did you change your username
oh whats asus doing
I FOUND IT https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgQInx5xH5E
change of plans
forget this im not waiting
it keeps on putting country music on my mix
so i had a crappy run today
im still glad i was able to use youtube today
the cool thing about the new steam appearance is that its more compact
it has not been a month already
seriously though dysphoria instrumental is fire
idk if you would like it
i dont know what your taste in music is
i wish the clock still had the seconds
check out the steam client beta if you wanna
/rndply/s main goal is to blow up
1738
i cant believe i finally managed to find it
the new steam window is glitchy
delete that message
still had nothing to do today
why is vandoorea dripfeeding videos
hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
ok here it goes
wait how did it get moved down
oh i got a lua error
i think i reached a limit
can this be fixed???
aprils still over?
done done it
imagine using a seamless portal to have like portable media player
i went to some spot that drops my fps a crapton
also need a way to convert a video to gif
https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/2773405248/4990570993584642786/ this discussion blew up
and im like the only one who actually helped them
i shoulda just done this
eh
i should turn some of my clips into sprays
why does gavin always get himself in trouble
why does /rndply/ always get themselves in trouble
is there a reason to use reshade in a video player
whack looking barrel
whack looking /nearprop/
kinda fun seeing how much crap you can put on a gun
making abominations
now thats cool
i thought a g3a3 was a battle rifle
yo dawg i heard you like shotguns so we put a shotgun on your shotgun
i wasted precious time yesterday
i could have went and downloaded vandooreas portal remixes
https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/13j2q1q/rip_mineplex_2013_to_2023_official_shutdown/
wish i could rename vlc playlists
so i have no time to
uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuugh
aha i know what to do
im ending up having to do some tricks to get as much as i can while still being within limits
limit reached
youtube getting me into vocaloid songs and country music
i didnt know lambda players say their fall lines
it works
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTBXwxQMlss maybe free track i havent checked the bandcamp page
theres volume 2 pb tracks?
last time i went on projectborealis.com i only saw volume 1
instead of using a soundcloud account to just download something from there just use youtube-dl or yt-dlp
i still use yt-dlp
based
pegasus more like megasus
lets finally go for a day
|nearmusicbox|i listened to the song today on the bus
|nearmusicbox|its almost just like when i was at that high school in maine
so im going like 3 days in a row unable to go on youtube
i wish i could go back
so today i told someone that i was a girl and he was like oooooh im sorry
he told like 2 people as well
so that was awesome
i wish i had all the songs
why do my hands feel wet
i updated my workshop item and got logged out of steam but it didnt show me error
custom chat got an update that i missed
feels a little weird
crap really?
|nearmusicbox|crap really?
is that the confederate states of america flag
maybe i should get those eft guns
we have 2 /rndply/s
i subscribed to eminem
subscribe to eminemmusic
i think the tourettes guy vp would be good for roleplay
wth is ome.tv
whats wrong with omegle
why hes switching faster than the channels on tv?
seen envmap and phong together plenty of times without realizing
you should make your own text profile for lambda players
if you want to
i dont know what im gonna eat tomorrow morning
i founds omething
what was oh right
i hope you didn't get that reference
cough cough
are you listening to music
what do you listen to
|nearmusicbox|heard the same crap like 5 times already
bad timing
echo instrumental is good

i literally refreshed youtube like 10 times today and i did not see my mix any of the times that i refreshed
whats going on with physics
where should i share files
oh you know what i should have done
im gonna do that next time
why is my skin so soft
"but i hope its soon" and it literally happens the next day
i got what i wanted done

i should try some more fun entities from the workshop
idk if its 1 or 2

|nearmusicbox|huh?
it happens yes
the lambda players sfoh text profile now has 2000 idle lines

i wish i could use d3d11 in gmod
i see that dh_uber_rt has some ssr optimization
oh hey
rtx on
its been awhiiiiiiiiile
how does that depth option manage to work so well in source
yeah dh_uber_rt is a free ray tracing shader that gives good results
whats what
gmod realism right here
looks like dh_uber_rt is the way to go for now
i got an idea for tomorrow
well let you down is definitely going on self radio at some point
kind of feels like im being punished already
yeah all of pedwiiks remixes are name your price
why is there so much slowed and reverb crap
well i found the thunder auto generated video
fall is a good song

|nearmusicbox|oh no the music
ok i lost all my stuff
what has this become
what has my life become
ok im not sure if im doing this correctly but
probably gonna have mixed feelings about the mod
whats your opinion about being able to take the emplacement gun in mmod
hl2 overcharged seems like a way over the top version of mmod
its an abomination
mortar synth damage changed with difficulty am i right
whats this branch called x86-64-temp
somethings going on guys
yeah 64 bits back from the dead
uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuh

the game looks awful with no antialiasing
whats up with him
what happened with snoop dogg and eminem
i wish i could put r_worldlights above 4
this banding is bad
everyone went quiet
did they change or remove the headcrap normal maps?
it looks much better when theres a light
i feel like source just interprets ssbumps as a regular normal map
just want this to end alrea
who keeps on placing inappropriate spray
weird thing happens when i pickup object
reshade depth buffer detection goes whack
mmmmmmmmmm
hang on

this is like finding sherds and putting them back together
weirdo /self/

yyyy-mm-dd or yyyy/mm/dd is the best date format
|quietserver|love how quiet it is
wish it was always like that

you should watch nolifeshaqs reaction to godzilla its really funny
im hungryyyyyy
grilled burgers are awesome
ive done nothing today
gonna go to bed hungry
MY WALL
this looks kinda cool though
whys there a download option on youtube
i wonder why that song is so popular
how do i make a base
uuuuuuuuuuuh ok
ayyyyyyyyyy
is it possible to lower rendering settings for rt cameras
i managed to fix the weirdness
yo i made a drone
you gotta see this this is gonna be
it needs to be more compact
ok im making a new drone i thin
you have no idea how many methman123s ive had play music in voice chat and had to ignite them for it
wiremod has the worst turret model options
lets see if this is better
this is op
like how is this actually possible
i wish you would come and see this
i wish i knew how to use a wiremod keyboard to control stuff
i realized that making the user angled up is a bad idea
but this is really cool and im glad i did something in gmod
|nearmusicbox|ARE YOU SERIOUS
i should hit 5000 hours tomorrow if i play gmod
since when can render targets be higher than your screen resolution
oh crap crapcrapcrapcrapcrapcrapcrap
|lowhp|oh crap crapcrapcrapcrapcrapcrapcrap
oh this is the best thing ever
|pmtime|id say this was a good day
im about to reach 5000 hours
im gonna make a drone
i like how i was like wait what
i reached 5000 hours
STOP DOUBLE CLICKING
yeeeeeeeeah
wait until anticheat catches me for these stupid double clicks
STOP
i hate myself
so yeah didnt know /rndply/ knew about that song
i suddenly dont feel so good
cant believe it
but it makes sense
remember that thing i had like before april 1st
i still miss april 1st
i should make buttons that emit sounds
sound emitters are confusing
when did i get another kill???
i wanted to troll the whole server
why is mirror rendering broken
have you ever
kinda funny doing this
yeah 2^n mp7 is really op
oh someone trashed this place
so 4000 to 5000 hours probably took about a year
|nearmusicbox|and we were off to a great start
and we were off to a great start
well its not rendertargets breaking the mirror
uh what
IT WAS A MISINPUT
im glad lvs vehicles dont take damage from crashing into the sky
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87jqQhFFomA
i forgot what the edict limit in gmod is
i need help
WAKE UP /self/
|nearmusicbox|WAKE UP /self/
why is there an error
bum bum
somebody help me
i need to wake up
uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
|pmtime|weird things happen when its this late
no nothing weird is going on
that oh was a super delayed reaction to something
id have to shovel dirt and dig a hole to get on yours you bum bum
at least im not really spamming anymore
at least not as much
crap whats the 1.20 release date
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr0fojaP6M4
ok so what am i gonna do now
oooooooooooooooh crap
dh_uber_rt performance just gets better and better
alright lets get into it
and the game freezes
i did not do it
thank goodness im taking a shower tonight
this was a stupid idea
i think at this point i need to accept that it will not stop
|amtime|its too early for this crap
i already cant take it
no stop
NO
i cant believe this is happening right now
im dreaming right now right
I DID NOT DO IT
|nearmusicbox|what in the switching faster than the channels on tv is going on today
i cant take this
this stuff is too much for my half a brain cell to handle
that was smooth
cough cough you cant see it
yeah this is all just a bad dream
im probably gonna cry
why did they remove motomami los santos
rip motomami los santos
i need to stop gaslighting myself
someone please help me
im taking a break
WHAT AM I DOING
OH MY GOODNESS
that should not be there
you tell me what am i doing because i sure dont know
you know what
WHAT A BEAUTIFUL DAY
|nearmusicbox|AYYYYY
this is probably one of the best bad ideas executed ever
thank you thank you thank you
AM I DREAMING???
ok no more
pov its a morning in 2019 and you're going to school
can this day just end already
thank goodness this is only today
why did i do this?
i once again apologize for the spam
who else do i have to let my feelings out to?
guts over fear is a good song though
i was surprised to see eminem doing a song with sia
i think eminem is also in some sza song
someone in real life needs to wake me up
whats up with this /nearprop/
its like colliding with itself
maybe its imploding
it stopped
how can this day be even better
i wonder how much the loading times in uh hl2 would be affected if i compressed the vpks and maps
am i fully awake
im probably about as awake as im gonna get today
im surprised i havent had any bad feelings about this new steam look
i get sad when i see that motomami los santos is missing
im not gonna lie this is awesome
that could have been very bad
i feel like something broke
i need to snap back to reality
i need to see no life shaq react to fall
what is my game doing
i feel like crap now
this is so wack
that was so wack
some pretty mixed feelings
yeah ive calmed down
ooooooooooh no
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
what is this fps
my disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined
|nearmusicbox|that is a dangerously addictive song
do textures in most games still have no size compression
what am i supposed to do here???
aaaaaaaaah how do i get help
wth is this /nearprop/ doing
whats updog
what was updog
oh i miss yesterday
uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuh
imagine having a picture of your pet as a profile pic
im so gonna trash this
i wonder if source or gta v has more physically accurate phong
every time i listen to godzilla i get lost after i dont wanna hurt em
fill em with the venom and eliminate em in other words i minute made em
|crowded|why is everybody by my base
get the heck outta here
quit messing with my crap please
and steam is glitching out when i click anything that opens something
enjoy the new steam update
mirrors are still broken
lunch break
i got too much time to do nothing
box him in
camouflage
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyHrkKQ_d_0 lol
why do i have /kills/ kills
get out get out get out
IT WAS A MISINPUT CALM DOWN
also dont click that
i wonder when im gonna map again
i wonder if the garbage collector in gmod could be improved to not drop your fps so hard
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PehQHraF7-U this video was me on june 13
gavin in 2023 putting angelbrained on media player
i think this estrogen might be doing something to me
it really feels like i dont have enough time in the day
i have literally like 13 hours
i feel like lambda players lacks attention
i have no idea how to do anything in lua
do lambda players still break with sap bots
no?
look at this its working fine
oh /rndply/ is here?
hey /nearply/ do you wanna help me test something?
/rndply/ come here for a sec
no prop pushing or prop killing please
did a clip i saved in a dream make it into real life?
did i save a clip in a dream where i was playing gta v and it somehow made it into real life?
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2985918977
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2989648750
and also https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2989850344
if you guys really think sanic has ruined the workshop wait until you see skibidi toilet all over the place in most popular
i wish i could make a script that auto writes sap bot text lines to a file
what is wrong with mke
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nz8WaJTodLU
godzilla is one of my favorite eminem songs
the heck does holographically projected his voice mean
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH
BOSS FIGHT TIME
this is the most fun ive had in a while
what do i have to do while i eat
what an interesting mix
holy crap theres so many decals here
it murders my gpu
prop pushing npcs easily does millions of damage
we should have a sap bot boss fight
i forgot sap bots say if they're stuck
how much health do you think would be good for a boss
the dark age has been found
you dont tell me anything
|nearmusicbox|wh why
|nearmusicbox|just why
this day still kinda sucks
i said a lot of crap today
why do i say things that nobody cares about
im having a pretty good day today
lots of things happening today
|highping|the lag is bad
|nearmusicbox|why cant i ever get enough of this song
clang
/rndply/ is this your /nearprop/?
what is going on today?
i hate today
i said a lot of crap yesterday
i just have to keep trying
its not gonna work
is the emplacement gun actually an ar3
these lvs vehicles are literal tanks
does lambda players also consider vmfs as maps?
i really wish i had kick
what are the coordinates that the coreball works properly at
this thing is trippy
woooooooah
ah if only gta v didnt crash on the loading screen
i dont know why i dont ever talk with lambda players
i wish i could write my chat history to a file
I DONT KNOW HOW TO DO ANYTHING WITH LUA
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah
do you have any idea what happened with me
WHY DO I MISS IT
HELP ME
can we just appreciate the 3d audio that most 3d games have
just come back
you have to tell me whats going on
im worried
im so gonna
mmmmmmmmmmmmm
look i gotta keep trying this
you know i miss june 13
it was an interesting experience
theres a hole in the world
I CANT SEE
lets hope that doesnt make it in a clip im never gonna watch
hl2 for the xbox looks weird
i hate sundays
sometimes i feel like it was dumb
what am i talking about
crap crap crap crap
AAAAAAAAAAA
caused a couple million dollars in damage
i still hate firefighters
gta v at 11 pm hits different
https://github.com/papadanku/CShade/commit/c71f512d88ab486563cd2528d4f81ccdd95877ba well thats a stupid change
no no no
honestly if media player got basic locational audio for youtube i would probably leave the tvs on
this is awkward
uuuuuuh
im not spawning a music box today because i dont wanna deal with it
ok someone spawned one
ey /rndply/
who spawned 2 /nearprop/s lol
|quietserver|this is the calmest server in the world
im bored and tired
i realized that if i make a multiplayer game anyone can join
vlc is really bad at getting album art for tracks
got a nice flat 144 fps
for some reason adding phong when theres envmap it square roots the tint
next gen graphics
rimlight is something all these materials were missing
stupid normal maps
you cant have a perfectly flat normal map it looks like
this is better than doing nothing with lambda players
/rndply/ went silent
i edited a good amount of materials to add phong and rimlight
real life but every day is saturday
these xqm materials have some interesting looking normal maps
does rimlight act as a second phong?
this crap making me wanna run cupscale on these normal maps
gmod could at the very least support phong and rimlight on lightmappedgeneric textures
YOU NEED BUMPMAP FOR PHONG TO WORK
i dont get what the point of $nocull is
oh this is gonna be a bad idea
and someone is already using the bad spray
i wonder how they got those
i just got a message from xbox lol
ok so i can get notifications when someone messages me on xbox
gmod using 45% vram
i like how lua fixer makes things work
why am i not that tired
i should just spawn like 10 or 20 lambda players with the GET UP GET UP GET UP voice profile and voice chance at 100
whats the model path for this /nearprop/
/kills/ kills and /deaths/ deaths
no reason to use translucent along with alpha test
just use wiremod if you need multiple rt cameras
can bass play webm files
www.un4seen.com/doc/#bass/bass.html info about bass
imagine replacing the whole engine audio system with bass
what is going on on reddit
how do i put r_worldlights above 4
ok well
wow this looks so good
|nearmusicbox|what if i have this on loop
people really listen to just one song on loop?
this sucks
|nearmusicbox|kinda bored of this track
is perfect bhopping hard using the scroll wheel
do you make use of links
that rms/peak option in the vlc compressor is confusing
/rndply/?
someone called /rndply/ joined the server
i need to see if deadwater gaming has a hl2 overcharged video
i wanted to make a joke with someones username when they were here
give me username ideas now
this /nearprop/ seems awfully shiny
lol see it didnt take that long
only with arc9 guns can i miss 80% of my shots
i tried to go a few days without
guess its time to come back
i cant believe it actually happened
am i still dreaming?
is this like a really long dream or something
WAIT
ITS TIME TO PUT PHONG ON ALL THE WORLD TEXTURES
oh hold on HOLD ON
i want to know whats going on with you because im worried
updated 64 bit is real
i think media player is broken from the new gmod update
i didnt think 64 bit would be updated
LOOK
wait wait wait wait
i still havent looked around online for clothes
can this day get any crazier
have you heard of this super cool text profile for lambda players
im hoping you dont know about that song ive gotten addicted to
imagine how fun it might be us playing together with lambda players
phong on lightmappedgeneric textures are you kidding me
unfortunately media player is broken rn but i think it wouldnt be an issue for you
youtube started an experiment where they dont let you use the site if you have an ad blocker
is this just a coincidence
christruct is a pretty small map crap
im not doing anything dont worry
oh so ive been meaning to ask you this
oh yeah hang on
i found like a good amount of songs on youtube that i remember hearing on the radio in 2019
you know i keep on talking about that
i still cant believe 64 bit got updated
by the way how are you liking the steam update
ok first jank thing
still wish we all had minecraft
what games could we play together that work
did you miss what i had on april 1st
can chatgpt tell me why the new nwvars wont show up
im afraid to lose you
i dont know why i said that
hey its good for you to be back
i wonder where i can get some usernames for my lambda players
i got 12 gb of gta v clips
have you played hl2 overcharged
the nice thing about you being here and me talking to you is that i might get some better response lines for my text profile
idk if you also watched jollys half-life google translate edition video
i had been wondering what mod changed that locker to say cicero
the gmblox character physics is like some crappy made physics in a scratch project
it would be cool if i could share my clips to you
oh yeah on april 1st i also did another joke where motomami los santos was my favorite radio station
i always have a stream radio but play no music
request a song
im really gonna miss listening to music and playing minecraft riding the bus on the way to school
oh no chromium branch is gone
oh yeah do you know vandoorea
gmod update lets go
i know i asked you this like 4 times but i wonder what kinds of music you like
what i could try is going back to the main branch and do it
when geoff says GET UP GET UP GET UP
oh i just realized today its been a year since i found that song
have you played entropy zero 2
just wondering
i saw some deadwater gaming video a little while ago
im glad you werent here on june 13th
they say zero was zero
alright good news
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nzn-x802TI
|nearmusicbox|here i am listening to this song again when i shouldnt be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyHrkKQ_d_0
|nearmusicbox|im about to put this song on self radio and someone needs to stop me
WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME
I NEED A REASON
crap im not even ready for whats to come
i wanna leave a dislike on that addon
something wacky was going on with my hearing 2 days ago when i was playing gta v at night
|nearmusicbox|yay im listening to this song again
|nearmusicbox|why do i listen to this
what would your reaction be if you saw someone with over 1000 kills
i wish my pc could run gta v at 144 fps almost all the time
i think i might
i stack chips you barely got a half eaten cheeto
today feels weird
feels kinda like june 13
i just know im not gonna be feeling good after i eat this
you couldnt stop me
im about to quit gta v
oh yeah what a day
hey whats up
i kinda wanna new gpu
i know newer ray traced games will run like crap on my gpu
i wanna talk about this music so bad but i know you're not interested
|nearmusicbox|this track right here has gotta be my #1 favorite
i can see why the obs studio application audio capture is beta
is that mine
update?
my eyes burn
wheres the strap
im bad at both typing and minecraft on mobile
what am i gonna do
you know what im really gonna miss
well i guess this isnt the most appropriate time to be discussing that
if reshade worked on proton there might have been a chance for me to move to linux
i wonder if theres a way to save vlc audio/video filters for specific files
saying this to you because i havent found anything but i could also just look it up
a little mind dump from time to time
shes gonna get mad at me again
oh wait gmod update out
do you ever have something so crazy or unbelievable happen that you stand up
oh when will i get a vr headset
why did i say that
were back
i didnt play gmod until it was lateish because i thought i wasnt gonna be able to use my workshop addons offline
at least i finally got to updating my map though
https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/2027229603007718498/DA32F55C8D4345EFCA71780F8605F3ABBA9E7F6F/?imw=5000&imh=5000&ima=fit&impolicy=Letterbox&imcolor=#000000&letterbox=false
why is the game freezing again
what does that mean
TWICE IN A ROW
im upset like the other day again
whats your favorite time of the day
by the way we got a new mod called entropy zero uprising
i dont even have info on half-life gearbox soundtrack
i literally dont care about more than 99% of the music in this decade
im still trying to find songs from the 2010s
those are the days i really need back
oh im about to leave late
nothing happened
does aac or opus have better compression
i think youtube uses opus doesnt it
eminem you gotta stop this word play
he would come up with something that would take me a few hours in a few seconds
i feel like my life was going alright until
is it just me or does $envmapfresnel not work at all
hang on a sec
oh it works
weird thing wth is t his
i think this gmod update broke something
i wonder if unmastered tracks are good for listening
crusher provided an unmastered version of echo instrumental
not sure if gmod bass system supports opus
yeah i dont know if you know this but i extended echo instrumental
i wanted to upload it to youtube but i didnt know how i was gonna make the video
im so glad source has envmap fresnel
i know its like a book and a half of crap i sent
sorry
do you happen to know why youtube now shows a download option for videos as a non premium user
make it stop
i need to go see what the requirements for youtube videos is
i couldnt take it
im glad i kinda minimized my usage of google stuff
for some reason i feel like i wanna send something but not this
i thought about making a joke about when i said im here
if you dare use that i will fill you with the venom and elimate you
i got my answer
looks like lua fixer might have been the one breaking lambda player combat
i always say this but i dunno if im gonna make it tonight
gonna fall asleep
its almost that time what am i gonna do
still not entirely sure what im feeling
what do you think i should do
woah woah what just happened
did anyone else just feel like they were falling or something
anyway what i said 8 minutes ago
do you ever download things from google drive
crap wait until mediafire starts blocking people using ad blockers
yeah thats a random thought cause the youtube thing
inb4 mediafire doesnt let you use the site if you use a blocker
saying it like its not gonna be me who makes the decision
why do i act like some things i do were done by someone else
i literally make a big deal out of things ive done sometimes
ah thats just normal probab;y
name one song thats better to listen to at night time
im not ready to wake up tomorrow
|4thjuly|can we go at least 4 seconds without someone saying happy 4th of july
|4thjuly|try not to say happy 4th of july for 10 seconds challenge (impossible)
|4thjuly|do you guys really have to be talking about 4th of july every 10 seconds
|4thjuly||pmtime|sounds like a war going on outside my house
|4thjuly|hey no disrespect to this holiday though
|4thjuly|oh its the 4th of july today
|4thjuly|i dont do anything special on this day
|4thjuly|what do you guys do on this day
what do you want
STOP LOOKING AT ME
|4thjuly|well no wonder why the chat was going insane over today
i watched a no life shaq video where he didnt stand up
i hate my stupid brain so much
ah 2019 come back
whos the majority of these people that
i cant even talk about this crap
im not gonna bother talking with you about it cause i know you dont have any answers
im just gonna forever gonna wonder what the heck is going on with that crap
what are you looking at me for you got a problem?
im gonna kill you if you dont stop looking towards me
/rndply/ i muted you because you played music in voice chat
how does jolly do the subtitles in his old videos when he didnt even have a mic
youtubes been teasing me with the videos it stopped putting on my mix by showing me them as the thumbnails for those stupid music of japan/asia/j-pop playlists
that doesnt look good
bruh who keeps on giving me awards on that crap
one day i gotta find something to give an award to
|nearmusicbox|these songs are gonna have me crying one day
|nearmusicbox|OH HECK NO
SOMEONE HELP GET ME THROUGH THIS PLEASE
anyway looks like av1 is causing weird clip durations so im not gonna be using that
not something you see every day
i saw no life shaq react to some funny and weird things yesterday
is there a way to avoid the youtube compression people talk about
|nearmusicbox|are you sure you're not interested in this kind of music
i do some pretty violent mouse shaking have you seen it
im gonna tell you something that i can promise
as soon as i get a clip exported in kdenlive i will upload it to youtube soon
i promise
i got a clip of me blowing up like 30 slams in entropy zero 2
gh
|nearmusicbox|gh
|nearmusicbox|what about this song right here you sure you arent interested in stuff like this?
i talked a lot right there
forget about that other question you gotta be sure
this next gta better be good
i thought i couldnt get much crazier
when i think i peaked i end up getting worse
i dont really understand why they made the floor buttons in portal rtx look like they're made of glass
im gonna play gmod tomorrow
WHAT MONTH IS IT
i dont think im ok
when did i hear counting stars
how long has youtube been using opus
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
im gonna fall again
no matter what kind of music you like i think we can all agree that independence fm is the best radio station in gta iv
i swear it was sunday like 2 days ago
also i didnt fall but i felt like i was gonna get that falling feeling again
im glad one of my favorite tracks is a free download
how many people would not wanna watch my gta v clips when they have a track on the radio playing
|pmtime|im just waiting for this day to be over
it has to not get processed if i upload it in the formats that youtube uses
oh sorry
oh sorry again
did you say something
hmm i need some help
oh hang on
forget that
didnt realize what you were talking about for a sec
might try another day
i bet opus at 160 kbps still sounds really good
just listened to a song i havent heard in like over a decade
who knew certain colors would remind someone of something
still wondering how i
i could name myself so many things for april fools
is it just me or are these phx props looking really good
did it happen
almost that time again
|nearmusicbox|wth did i just hear
im never gonna learn how to put pictures in audio files
i wonder if
still kind of upset
what a beautiful night
something happened
oh i hope i can get an av1 video exported
i wonder whats different
i promise im gonna upload something soon whether i export in av1 or not
if it goes as planned im gonna have like 1 or 2 new videos and my channel will be updated and cleaned up
im gonna get uncomfortable
its gonna suck updating my channel
alright im gonna stop
good night when you leave
dashes or slashes in dates/
i think im gonna upload that gta v clip with the guy falling off the bridge
i would like to make an update video but i dont know how i would do it
well it was a beautiful day
its a beautiful day again
haha surprise message
im so gonna play some music the next time i play minecraft bedrock edition
what a day this has been so far
ive seen some weird things today as well
hope project borealis is ok with their tracks in my video if i upload it
what has happened with me
what is going on with this crap
|nearmusicbox|what is going on with this crap
|pmtime|im tired
is there something that can wake me up
with this crashing going on with gta v its possible i might play it less often but idk
if gta iv had a director mode i would have played it way more often
my clips are getting ridiculous
how in the world
FIREWALL
gonna be a lil late but for good reason
i dont even know the last time i played quake 2
im not exporting with libaom-av1 ever again
alright now the worst part
its safe to go to my channel now
woo im done with that
|pmtime|i already spent enough time not playing anything today
I HAVE A /weapon/
hopefully ill get a gta v clip out tomorrow
i dont even know what im gonna play tomorrow
since when was it called aimlabs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW-JI9EM24M
bruh my other video got 33 views already what the heck
how did my video get over 30 views in less than a day
i have another ez2 clip rendered that i will probably upload tomorrow
im back though
im only gonna upload gta v clips with something playing on the radio if the music is ok to use in your own videos
this is all that ive been talking about today
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_XAOrZsy3o
oh what am i gonna do tomorrow
i dont really wanna go a 3rd day in a row playing gmod
its dark in here
dont know what to do tomorrow
my pencil get killed
i might have to quit gta v for real
ive been playing for 10 hours
yes im still talking about my clips on youtube
im scared to play gta v
i dunno if im gonna play gta iv tomorrow
you remember what i said i was gonna do next time
WHAT DID I DO

i remember the first time i played this game
woah wth happened here
this game is kinda fun
sup can a loc come up in yo crib
what did you think i said you did
might play some more of this tomorrow idk
kinda miss when the internet was going crazy over that franklin and lamar cutscene
this map feels like a gmod tornado map
this game is so oddly fun i think i might play it again tomorrow
i thought traffic in gta v since june 13 was bad but i forgot about traffic in gta iv
|pmtime|its really that late already
glad to be changing things up a bit even if its only for a few days
fools out here trying to recreate gmod in teardown
i dont like how theres way less variety and scenarios in gta v
gta iv seems to have the best variety in peds
i hope the next gta is like gta iv
i dont know whats going on with me
probably gonna buy some music off of bandcamp
where else can i download some music
i would buy eminem albums if i knew where to do it
but im gonna go buy some vandoorea albums soon
why dont i either say idk or i dont know and not switch between the two
how does alac compare to flac
|nearmusicbox|woah woah woah woah
somebody please tell me whats going on
i cant take that
not you
im done for now
|nearmusicbox|excuse me what
|nearmusicbox|woah the server has this song?
finally pain voice type for lambda players
oh what is going on
got one less game for me to play
i know im making a big deal over something small
|pmtime|earlier tonight i watched more life shaq react to ai drake heart on my sleeve
i dont even know why i did that
i dont know what went wrong
i dont know whats going on
WHY IS THIS HAPPENING
WHAT IS GOING ON
you know it takes a lot for me to cry
oh what has happened to me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M99TwOt-j4I
im about to drop another video
im not even gonna say anything to you
did my keyboard just disconnect
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La3Q-7etU_4
getting a little game clip out on youtube is super easy btw
youtube needs to stop messing with me
im talking about that crusher song again
i talked about echo so many times
1.20 is out?
1.20.1 exists?
what is going on with the internet lately with stuff
oh i might have to quit youtube already
YOUTUBE WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU
i gotta remember that its not just me that is falling apart
now what am i gonna play tomorrow
this is partially why i say i hate myself
|pmtime|im turning off decals for the night
i dont feel like playing teardown again
i need to just go to sleep now
why didnt i make thumbnails for my videos
the videos i upload are literally in the most youtube format as possible but when i look at the stats for nerds it says avc01
still dont know what im gonna play tomorrow
i gotta watch stampy again
im not playing gmod tomorrow
i gotta find something to do
i was never able to see if 1.20 released because stuff started happening on r/minecraft
|nearmusicbox|wth is this music
how am i supposed to know when em drops an album
i wonder how they manage to optimize the gmod san andreas map even more
ah yes my first gta v video on youtube
already got over 1000 hours in obs studio
wow look what vanillatweaks got
im gonna have to play minecraft again soon
every time i play minecraft i tell myself i gotta play some music
i love the new cherry wood
did something happen to the minecraft wiki cause yesterday i saw a phoenixsc video about it that i didnt watch
i miss listening to music while playing minecraft that was awesome
i didnt even get many chances to listen to my favorite track while going to school but i got a couple
one time i watched that grian minecraft video where they were playing the 23w13a_or_b snapshot and they had the voice chat mod and i was amazed by the directional audio on the voice chat
music i buy from bandcamp and download isnt gonna be drm protected will it
whys the color of the cherry wood attractive to me
you didnt even get a chance to check out 1.19 did you
just gonna not use reddit
i no longer have a reason to go on reddit
was a nice 3 years while it lasted
vandooreas guard down remix got the gta san andreas theme near the end
i realized something last night
im gonna watch the video in gmod hold on i gotta check it out
why is it just now i noticed it
south of the border better be one of those songs
im already pretty happy today for some reason
|nearmusicbox|this track is so fire i cant leave
oh what a beautiful day
im not saying anything
who else is watching stampy in 2023
stampy is playing with ray tracing???
i still cant get over that detail i just noticed about echo
theres gotta be a new zenate track batch out
i miss urban coalition weapons
i moved on from arccw
my skins feeling really soft today
i see why you fools like free bird
stampy always uses ray tracing now
oh what can i do in gmod
im gonna bring back more of my childhood
im gonna live my life like
maybe i should play minecraft for a little bit when i wake up
can this just be over already
why do i play gmod
i was going crazy
why was shaq making a big deal out of someone saying the n word when he says it all the time
look how stupid this looks now
we got shiny fading rainbow materials now
i think im gonna make a sky fortress maybe
the fading rainbow with the reflections look so cool
this is the gamer material
where do i listen to ems first album
/rndply/ connected to the server
i cant believe eminem replied to nolifeshaq
i didnt make any sky fortress
i just got an idea
i miss playing with lucky blocks now
the original lucky block mod is actually available for fabric now
how did i go from never using github at all other than occasionally reporting bugs to using it every day of my life
i was gonna say i know im gonna end up having like 5 popularmmos videos on my media player
i just wanna watch videos from the older days when everything was fine
what the heck is neoforge
those modrinth ads are so tiny
i wish i could use other windows while in a game
why does prism launcher have a cat button
feels like its winter again
LOOK AT WHAT IVE GOTTEN INTO
i spent a lot of time searching for the songs that i have found so far
now im watching stampylonghead and old popularmmos videos again
really bringing back the past
i gotta appreciate the fact that ive come back to a lot of old things
nethermind
cube root of 32768 what is it
i dont think ive been getting double clicks lately have i
oh i found a /nearprop/
https://store.steampowered.com/app/2410180/Portal_Prelude_RTX/
i gotta go find one of those trail ruins in my survival world
does it annoy you when i just say ah and stop instead of continuing
i was going to say something about us being in a certain place thats known for a certain weather
doesnt quite feel like it
yeah theres no way im gonna fall down now
this is getting uncomfortable
so when you refer to the guy next to the doc you meant shredder
when were waterlogged leaves added
do you know how to embed images in audio files
https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/2051985634562905741/CD48E4593D046F1C25BD9EC77D92DA6E0CD927D6/?imw=5000&imh=5000&ima=fit&impolicy=Letterbox&imcolor=%23000000&letterbox=false
before yesterday whens the last time i did this
aaah i need something to drink
some weird stuff is going on my game
i have to be allowed to do this
what am i doing
|nearmusicbox|ayyy found another song
theres songs i literally forgot existed but when i hear it it rings a bell
i already feel a bit of regret
|nearmusicbox|wth this song
ah whats wrong with me
|pmtime|its not even late late yet
|pmtime|now its almost late late late
when was it that i heard i dont care
i need to know when in 2019 no.6 collaborations project was released
ive literally had better luck finding songs accidentally that i didnt even know i remembered than finding songs that i know
ever since april 1st ive turned the online status back on
why do i keep changing
its always something about me that ends up being different after years
|pmtime|i have no idea how i made it this long with how early i got up today
yeah i definitely found at least 4 songs yesterday
why would anyone ask if a workshop addon is free of course it is
i find it so awesome that stampy now has ray tracing on in his videos
i felt like ive been crazy for listening to my own music while playing minecraft
i gotta play minecraft bedrock edition tomorrow
did they make the clock in the steam overlay bigger
|nearmusicbox|im done
i hope i have fun tomorrow
the heck is the memory offset for the latest bedrock version
at least stampy is still doing perfectly fine
i swear ive heard focus before
what other cursed gun customization can i do with the gsr guns
its awesome how i dont have to use a different username on places
we can enchant props in gmod now
this really felt like something
i still find it crazy that ive found some lost songs
someone suggest me some 2010s pop songs to put on my playlist
ai music everywhere
what i dont really like about opus is that it cuts off everything above 20 khz
this is insane
every single time i play with lambda players i have to slay or kick someone for playing music in voice chat
ive been missing those songs for 3 years
is something going on with me again
why is it so hard for me to find some mods to play with
also nothings going on
I CANT DRAG ANYTHING
my mouse keeps on double clicking and releasing
i feel like i gotta quit the game right now
i am still dead
i was dead
i gotta play pickcrafter again at some point
heres the thing though
i wanted to avoid playing pickcrafter because of the double clicks
ok seriously whats going on
i got 11 hours left
send help
i need something to do
i might have to quit gmod and play a different game
im burnt out
i was working on a little something in minecraft
do you think my double clicks might trigger pickcrafter anticheat
i know i gotta play gta iv
i cant wait to come back to gta v but i want to wait for a specific day
gotta stop talking and see what i can do
i usually dont play more than one game a day thats why im hesitating
|nearmusicbox|OH MY
i might quit already
for some reason its always better doing nothing in gta than doing nothing in gmod
lets see how long it takes before i lose it
i got nothing to do
|nearmusicbox|bruh theres no way
no way no way no way
|nearmusicbox|REALLY
|nearmusicbox|this sucks
|nearmusicbox|THIS SUCKS
THIS SUCKS
|nearmusicbox|you gotta be kidding me right now
what happened with all the kamikaze vids on youtube
and why is youtube faking the updated thing on the artists playlists
new song with eminem dropped yesterday?
the heck am i doing am i gonna do something
i see that the person that asked me how to make a music pack published one
what in the world is going on on youtube now
i dunno what my pc is doing
i completely forgot that mcreator exists
|pmtime|yay its almost over
wth is going on with my graphics
since when did steam overlay have a timer
why have so many crazy things happened
i might have to play gta v on august 13
whats with people bringing source engine stuff into teardown
ah the good times when i played on super nostalgia zone
im dreaming
someone in real life wake me up please
dump some water on my face
half of a life isnt on bandcamp for some reason
someone let me know if no life shaq reacts to realest
this is the final stretch
the world moves on but im still in 2019 when i comes to pop
i will never want anything to do with any pop music from this decade
today was a good day for me
and yil that carpenter brut is on bandcamp
am i still dreaming
why me
who else is uuuuuuuuh
why dont i ever do my dates as mm/dd/yyyy anymore
were getting close to december
i need some christmas songs
idk if im gonna make it for 4 more days
dont you tell me that the gaps in mp3s was an audacity importing bug
well well well
hold on hold on hold on
maybe im not dreaming
maybe i wasnt dreaming
|nearmusicbox|how do i keep on finding these songs
im gonna do something different today but still be bored
when you run out of stuff you want so you just wanna buy some music
no i dont think i can buy eminem albums because of the platforms they're on
found one song today and one yesterday
i miss chilling in a place listening to music
https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/2020479276689765288/5D164E87E51BBBEF22904983A24585093C4F500C/?imw=5000&imh=5000&ima=fit&impolicy=Letterbox&imcolor=%23000000&letterbox=false
JUNE YOUTUBE IS BACK
i need april youtube again
ever just miss winterr
looks like this map might be good to rp in
kinda makes me miss playing gta v on foot
today i saw the impossible happen
why is it so common for people to mess up minecraft textures in this engine
isnt it nice to actually be able to use your pc right after you start it up
we got today and tomorrow to get through
im burnt out on like everything
im not sure what i wanna put on my radio
but seriously what is going on with youtube
im feeling a lot of latency so my gpu might be bottlenecking
mee is insane
woah i said a lot of stuff sorry
if it wasnt for source limits you could fit a decent chunk of the gta v map into a map
is reddit still falling apart or already fallen apart
yep i knew we were gonna get a wave of youtube ad issues on uassets github
by the way that sucks
what would be the best place for me to hang out at
i found the location that the coreball works properly
i got an idea now
dont worry i know what i can do now
kind of like learn to fly all over again
|birthday|well well well look what day it is today

today i found out this is what you came for was written by taylor swift
ah what am i gonna put on it
were so close
|birthday|why they saying happy birthday this early
tomorrow is gonna be a good day
when is my actual birthday i dont remember
i still cant believe this is going on with me
what i hate about seeing a lambda player saying lines from my text profile is that i know the context to a lot of these lines
maybe i could start a discussion for people to ask for the context to any line they want and ill reply to them explaining it if i know
aaah i feel like im under pressure rn
im trying to make this quick
this is gonna be a good day
i think im done
im gonna love this
|birthday|i cant believe the day is finally here
i cant believe the day is finally here
do you know how long i had this game now
what a beautiful day so far
you know i have been gone for a while if some things in this game are making me laugh now
how have i been playing this game for 6 years already
for some reason i dont care reminds me of that time in 2020
how did you gon learn end up being one of my favorite songs from music to be murdered by
the sky be looking good today
also hi
feels like i was playing this yesterday
was that thunder or something else
what songs have i started to hear again at the beginning of this year
even if i dont get any music today i gotta be happy about what happened today
i swear i literally played this game yesterday or something
everything im doing again it feels like i just did it
hold on whats the date today
i dont care if you dont care its my birthday
ill tell you what i wanna tell you
still wish i could buy music to be murdered by though
i might never get some albums from some artists
also made myself a bandcamp account
i didnt make a new reddit account i dont think im gonna do it
i feel like i might be done with reddit unfortunately
every single thing i bought was half-life related
have i bothered you enough today
i basically dont know music genres at all so idk what else it is that i like
i have to remember this game i had for 6 years now starting today
how was this day
this game got me laughing hard
|pmtime|how has it been 12 hours already
|pmtime|today wasnt enough for me
how did this feel like literally yesterday and a while ago at the same time
look im gonna tell you something
|pmtime|i have been up for like 15 hours
|pmtime|i started playing this game almost 15 hours ago
|pmtime|today was chill
i been meaning to tell you hold on
dont even talk about june 13
you gotta think about the good things out of things
i like how github keeps on showing me things
today i found flac
getting tons of emails lately
i was burnt out on like everything i played
i like how after a break im glad to be back
do you wanna know an idea i have
im so gonna be burnt out on this game at the end of tomorrow
hey whats going on
was fun while it lasted
you know what the best time period of me playing gmod was in my opinion
someone help me live the older times
i would like to see if i can use gplacer to assist with making maps in hammer
i gotta start making some music as well
i dont even know how to make good images
aye aye aye thats a lot of messages
im telling you right now i want to try to live like its 2019
the world moves on but i never will
you know i have to talk to someone about things like this
im trying to make this like its 2019 as much as i can but i can only do so much
reminder that all these messages is good for my lambda player text profile
feels like i have trouble having some self control sometimes
please please please i hope nothing bad happens
wth is this sisyphus trend
there was an idea i had and another idea i had
|nearmusicbox|forget about those tracks im mad
i cant move on
i have to stay in 2019
inb4 i start playing minecraft 1.15 again
i just randomly started hating this decade much more now
i dont want anybody or anything shoving 2020s decade music in my face
i really need an easier and faster way to make links
look what you made me do
i might actually need less time in the day at this point
one of the goat building maps is open source thank goodness
when did all this creepy gmod stuff talk start
could this be bad
idk if we really are coming to a close
why are my arms sore
i seem to do things that most mappers dont do
i cant turn a func_detail back into a brush because to world isnt working for some reason
but enough talk because im not even mapping rn
i wish we could get the fightspace3b vmf
i like this map but it has a few annoying things
aaaaaaaah my arms
wth happened to hip hop
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah
im sorry but i really am an idiot sometimes
you're gonna be happy when i say this
it felt like it was 2019 at that moment
i was chilling watching no life shaq last night
im really doing something about this now
i had enough
do you know how far im going now
oh im halfway through addict now i think
do you see what im doing
did shaq ever react to remember the name
this is getting insane
i am going insane with this
im probably gonna remove 2 tracks from my radio tomorrow
supra mayro 64 still isnt out yet?
mayro i am of fsave
i just remembered something
i see sbox/raytracing
i havent given up games from this decade yet
i might have to stop watching no life shaq if hes being racist
so i got some time
bye bye 2021 and 2022 tracks
im not actually in 2019 im 17 days into 2020
thank goodness zero order kinetics was released in 2019
im so gonna have a heart attack today
|nearmusicbox|this the stuff right here
|nearmusicbox|this the kind of stuff im gonna listen to for the rest of my life
just completely forget about any music from like after february 2020
all i need from 2020 is music to be murdered by
how many days have i been talking about this now
keep the 2020s music away from me
do you wanna know what ive been doing the past 2 or 3 days
sorry one more thing
ay why does back to you sound like it did when i first rediscovered it
that scared the crap out of me
gonna message some fool while they're offline
i like how i use fool in place of person whatever
|nearmusicbox|i feel something
hey why am i feeling stuff
are you sure you dont wanna come with me
how many times have i been happy to be back at something after intentionally taking a break for some reason
WHy
i need the answer
no one ever tells me whats going on
i asked whats going on like a million times now
what im gonna like about s&box is that materials will always be accurate because it has pbr
shaq has to have reacted to remember the name
is eminem giving me a headache now
oh we got a gmod update?
i hope i dont have to quit github
we didnt get any gmod update
youtube has been unusable for me for the past few days and i tried everything
i need to find something to do
i gotta build something
i dunno what im gonna do tomorrow
if my gta v save really glitched out or something then im gonna have something to do
i barely built anything but this is amazing
this build is on fire
theres no good optimization mods for 1.15
when was 1.15 released
my framerate is pretty impressive
wish i wasnt feeling so tired in the day
i got 11 minutes help
so do you see what im doing now
2020/1/17 must have been such a good day i wish i remembered it
by the way i found another song today and it was what i thought it was
|nearmusicbox|i cant take it
well its one of those days
are you sure you dont wanna come with me
im going back to 2019 do you wanna come with me
dont tell me that tho is an actual english word
what does tho mean
im not looking forward to going on youtube tomorrow
i felt like i havent done anything but i actually messed around with source materials a lot
good feelings today
we need more days like this
bruh wth is this
how did it go from days going by fast to slow
youtube set me up
i didnt go on youtube today and i was like THANK YOU
wait hold on a minute
i need something like copy and paste but instead of duplicating the file it creates a symlink
come on i cant be sitting all the time
why dont i ever take screenshots
with all the songs i already found im still finding some i completely forgot about
aah theres this one song i think i know how it goes but i still havent found it
rip simfphys
i thought i forgot something
i wish we had a feature to ignore double clicks if the second click is too soon after the first one
i gotta acknowledge the anniversaries of the most random things
hey i got nothing to do
oh oh oh
why do i say dunno
oh youtube done did did something
why am i so bad at picking fonts
literally the only font i ever use is impact
march 1st 2020 was a sad day
i thought the gta v infmaps wouldnt get much better
thanks valve for not implementing any size compression for vtfs
what the heck am i seeing right now
the windows were open and i caught a feeling i havent had in months
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGuA5JPS2Xg
