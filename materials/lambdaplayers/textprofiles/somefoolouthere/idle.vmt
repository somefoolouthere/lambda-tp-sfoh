yay

take me somewhere
cruisin
i want vandoorea to make black mesa and entropy zero 2 remixes
been riding for the past 40 minutes
i still dont know why they added 5
partys over
black magic sounds like its so much older than it actually is
they're teasing us
i saw a really cool video  on reddit today
darkness
still need my gmod minutes
my pc is gonna turn off again
ok uh
i love this
this is even better
not a good map for making interiors out of props as you can see
laggy as heck
i hate these stupid food entities from crunchys pickups
the lighting looks awesome though
honestly almost looks like a ray traced render
well now i wanna go on justgrass and build it
alright things just keep on breaking im deleting this
gotta love 144 fps
sweet
sweed
this is already looking better
ah lets do hthis
now where do i put the light switch
precision building has never been so easy in gmod
its beautiful
oh you know what i could have done
ayy
i need to convert realworldtextures to material tool
remember when dxr in minecraft used to work better
miss those days
it sure does feel like im playing with ray tracing right now
gonna have a party in here
this thing is gonna be awesome when im done
this is gonna be bad for performance
i need a ruler tool
gonna have to do some pythag theorem
it would be more convenient if i could use the calculator in game
i should get a second monitor

nether mind

wow this is super broken
issue found https://github.com/wiremod/wire/issues/2552
so the sin of 45 is supposed to equal 1/√2
ive been insulted too many times today

4 months by the way
i dont need any advanced material tool cause map retexturizer lets me do it
id like to leave school early
hey we should like throw a party in here
triage at dawn is overrated
i heard someone listening to keep ya head up today
this material reminds me of the concrete material from roblox
i still think we should throw a party in here
uuh
im unsure how im gonna do lighting
im stuck
|nearmusicbox|pretty based music choice
you may not really like hip hop or you may hate it but you cant deny that 2pac made good music
imagine how good the gmod maps would look if we had support for phong on world textures and put phong like fake pbr on all the textures
not sure if you know this but in pbr 1 roughness still has a some shine
i worked with pbr textures in the past in minecraft
i gotta find a way to port my pack to java edition

rip 32 bit beamng.drive
it feels like something is missing now

is it 5.26 years or 5.3 years for cobalt
theres still more tracks i havent heard
for some reason this seems normal
yesterday was an awful day
its actually kinda painful listening to tracks like 10 minutes or longer
how do you like ambient music

oh whats going on with drunk headcrab
someone help me
i literally had 3 meals today and i feel like im starving

i dislike not afraid remix so much i left it out of my mix
i wonder if multithreading would greatly improve the speed
i miss b adams on my self radio
this better turn out how i wanted it to
i got a lag spike
im hungry
would be great if audacity used ram
i really need something to backup my crap
right now if my ssd dies i lose so many things
|nearmusicbox|was this song released in 2022
pretty glad i got 2 tb
why do i have 74% memory usage
its getting too close
dang it that scared me
i thought it crashed
crap did it again
gotta take a shower real soon
that was a mistake
how do i go back
well now i gotta redo the whole thing
i wish i didnt do that
i hate doing this
i think my anger made me take a shorter shower
i hate myself so much for that
i was literally like 4 minutes away from it being done
i see af23 addon i subscribe
and now i wait for the gmod devs to update x86-64
we wait
gmod seems dead right now
i did download the april 1st version of the tornado maps
steam froze
ok its unfrozen
people making schools in gmod
ooooooh
95% ram usage
why is it so high
only got 1.6 gb free
its gonna be alright
this sucks so much
10^(x/20)
dont worry guys we got small optimizations for seamless portals
i got a hair in my mouse and thought my pc froze
what is what
holy crap my pc is brought down to a crawl
lets finally play this game

i uninstalled the stupid movies and tv app
dysphoria is on self radio
not the best solution but it most certainly is the cheapest
wow nice joke i had there
my joke tracks linger after april 1st

the sad part about this is that i basically did this all on myself
i heard the cover version 3 times today its ridiculous

i have suppressed chromium.log writing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kwwl9jiJ1A4 idk if you remember this

who watches movies while playing games
i wonder what you even do
what crap do you play not on steam
https://i.redd.it/p01oh9u2czya1.png

that car looks kinda cool
that /nearprop/ looks kinda cool
i am still trying to find songs
was pretty productive in minecraft yesterday /s
i have a hosts file that somehow doesnt work in the gmod media player request browser
what difference do the x264 cpu usage presets have
at least i got stuff done today
its like that thing ive seen people do
whats my favorite track
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand
|nearmusicbox|oh yeah 2010s song time

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2974266637
at least theres a few songs i know the lyrics to fully
i got one subscriber
i got over 100 gb of gmod addons

aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah i dont have anything to do

i have no better ideas than the stupid one i had
i can see it
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah
whats the reason why i keep on getting shader cache downloads for portal rtx
i think i got the regex thing
and i wish it was 019
trying to make it a little more like 019
theres not much i can do
reshade has been stuck on compiling shaders for a while
ogg at quality 0 still sounds too good
if i make my own music im always gonna use 48000 hz
oh of course everyone likes stanky legg
da got that dope
i have no idea what to build
i hope i made 4 people happy
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2971265319 when you want the lambda player experience but not as crazy
i cant believe something i made got on the front page
why do the universal ammo entities and only the universal ammo entities give a lua error when a lambda player spawns it
come on lets go play with lambda players together
i hate crunchys ultimate item pickups so much
how to kill a gpu
why do i always say things like that
i wanna try to make a food spawner in gmod today
can you have transparent profile pictures in steam?
not sure what i wanna add
found something
new thing
easy precision looks pretty cool
i need 15 players
it seems weird that its happened so many times
i eat food for no reason
|nearmusicbox|WHY DOES THAT KEEP ON HAPPENING
WHY DOES THAT KEEP ON HAPPENING
gimme food
thats a stupid username /rndply/
making me nervous
the amount of times i heard who do you love today
map creator shoulda made those paths func_details
universal ammo isnt universal
is there any map good for 5 team ctf
forget it im blowing this up
how does my game not crash
|nearmusicbox|AGAIN
stop playing who do you love
i need some car models
dang iiiit
im glad gmod doesnt freeze anymore when something gets removed
uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuh

what day was it when i had that other thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReZm_e2LHB4

ads are just too intrusive in most places
i was aware something like this might happen one day
FLINT COAL
wheres this stupid thruster
wheres this stupid /nearprop/
im not sure what would happen if you drank blood
i really wonder what my blood type is
could you help me with that too
ok well phong and envmap are compatible
i did not know this material had phong and envmap at the same time
but can you have envmap and rimlight?
i will use lambda for playing hl2 in gmod
and the whole place is polluted with random props
uhoh
why did i spawn here
so the current plan is that im gonna go on youtube every single day until i cant anymore
like i plan on spending the entire tomorrow on youtube
4 years and 144 fps is still really smooth to me
i wonder if abh is patched in entropy zero 2
ah i wanna edit the navmesh but
forget it im doing it
what the
this is crazy
the closest thing we got to real time reflections on props
so yeah til you can have phong along with envmap
i was wondering why some decals disappeared when i went a certain distance
oh nooooooooo
i wonder what kinds of stuff i could draw
i dont stop doing stupid things
i dont play gta v on saturday anymore
gmod is boring too
literally every game i play is boring now
thats still bullcrap
func_details are used improperly on this map
yeah still trying to find songs and soon im not gonna be able to anymore
making cursed guns
yeah this looks very cursed
it could have been worse
ok this looks bad now
yeah there we go
oh this is awful
this looks bad too
nah im gonna make more cursed guns
i opted into the steam client beta
betterrtx is out but you can only get it from discord
insert skull emoji here that i cant insert because windows is a piece of crap sometimes
https://i.redd.it/fbmxrb02dsza1.gif
i can still go on the youtube website
noooooooo madotspooki why did you change your username
oh whats asus doing
I FOUND IT https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgQInx5xH5E
change of plans
forget this im not waiting
it keeps on putting country music on my mix
so i had a crappy run today
im still glad i was able to use youtube today
the cool thing about the new steam appearance is that its more compact
it has not been a month already
seriously though dysphoria instrumental is fire
idk if you would like it
i dont know what your taste in music is
i wish the clock still had the seconds
1738
check out the steam client beta if you wanna
/rndply/s main goal is to blow up
i cant believe i finally managed to find it
the new steam window is glitchy
delete that message
still had nothing to do today
why is vandoorea dripfeeding videos
hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
ok here it goes
wait how did it get moved down
oh i got a lua error
i think i reached a limit
can this be fixed???
aprils still over?
done done it
imagine using a seamless portal to have like portable media player
i went to some spot that drops my fps a crapton
also need a way to convert a video to gif
https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/2773405248/4990570993584642786/ this discussion blew up
and im like the only one who actually helped them
i shoulda just done this
eh
i should turn some of my clips into sprays
why does gavin always get himself in trouble
why does /rndply/ always get themselves in trouble
is there a reason to use reshade in a video player
whack looking barrel
whack looking /nearprop/
kinda fun seeing how much crap you can put on a gun
making abominations
now thats cool
i thought a g3a3 was a battle rifle
yo dawg i heard you like shotguns so we put a shotgun on your shotgun
i wasted precious time yesterday
i could have went and downloaded vandooreas portal remixes
https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/13j2q1q/rip_mineplex_2013_to_2023_official_shutdown/
wish i could rename vlc playlists
so i have no time to
uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuugh
aha i know what to do
im ending up having to do some tricks to get as much as i can while still being within limits
limit reached
youtube getting me into vocaloid songs and country music
i didnt know lambda players say their fall lines
it works
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTBXwxQMlss maybe free track i havent checked the bandcamp page
theres volume 2 pb tracks?
last time i went on projectborealis.com i only saw volume 1
instead of using a soundcloud account to just download something from there just use youtube-dl or yt-dlp
i still use yt-dlp
based
pegasus more like megasus
lets finally go for a day
|nearmusicbox|i listened to the song today on the bus
|nearmusicbox|its almost just like when i was at that high school in maine
so im going like 3 days in a row unable to go on youtube
i wish i could go back
so today i told someone that i was a girl and he was like oooooh im sorry
he told like 2 people as well
so that was awesome
i wish i had all the songs
why do my hands feel wet
i updated my workshop item and got logged out of steam but it didnt show me error
custom chat got an update that i missed
feels a little weird
crap really?
|nearmusicbox|crap really?
is that the confederate states of america flag
maybe i should get those eft guns
we have 2 /rndply/s
i subscribed to eminem
subscribe to eminemmusic
i think the tourettes guy vp would be good for roleplay
wth is ome.tv
whats wrong with omegle
why hes switching faster than the channels on tv?
seen envmap and phong together plenty of times without realizing
you should make your own text profile for lambda players
if you want to
i dont know what im gonna eat tomorrow morning
i founds omething
what was oh right
i hope you didn't get that reference
cough cough
are you listening to music
what do you listen to
|nearmusicbox|heard the same crap like 5 times already
bad timing
echo instrumental is good

for some reason my mediadata.json got wiped
OOOOOOOOOOOOOH

i literally refreshed youtube like 10 times today and i did not see my mix any of the times that i refreshed
whats going on with physics
where should i share files
oh you know what i should have done
im gonna do that next time
why is my skin so soft
"but i hope its soon" and it literally happens the next day
i got what i wanted done
so that was another "i plan on doing it eventually and then it turns out to happen the next day" moment
my keyboard locked up once i got into the game

baconmobile
i need to figure out something to do
i need to wait

i should try some more fun entities from the workshop
idk if its 1 or 2

the lambda players sfoh text profile now has 2000 idle lines

i wish i could use d3d11 in gmod
i see that dh_uber_rt has some ssr optimization
oh hey
rtx on
its been awhiiiiiiiiile
how does that depth option manage to work so well in source
yeah dh_uber_rt is a free ray tracing shader that gives good results
whats what
gmod realism right here
looks like dh_uber_rt is the way to go for now
i got an idea for tomorrow
well let you down is definitely going on self radio at some point
kind of feels like im being punished already
yeah all of pedwiiks remixes are name your price
why is there so much slowed and reverb crap
well i found the thunder auto generated video
fall is a good song

|nearmusicbox|oh no the music
ok i lost all my stuff
what has this become
what has my life become
ok im not sure if im doing this correctly but
probably gonna have mixed feelings about the mod
whats your opinion about being able to take the emplacement gun in mmod
hl2 overcharged seems like a way over the top version of mmod
its an abomination
mortar synth damage changed with difficulty am i right
whats this branch called x86-64-temp
somethings going on guys
yeah 64 bits back from the dead
uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuh

look at the side of it lol
the game looks awful with no antialiasing
whats up with him
what happened with snoop dogg and eminem
i wish i could put r_worldlights above 4
this banding is bad
everyone went quiet
did they change or remove the headcrap normal maps?
it looks much better when theres a light
i feel like source just interprets ssbumps as a regular normal map
just want this to end alrea
who keeps on placing inappropriate spray
weird thing happens when i pickup object
reshade depth buffer detection goes whack
mmmmmmmmmm
hang on
